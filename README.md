## Instructions:

- In the upper part the color that you must guess will appear in RGB format, in the lower part you will have 6 boxes with different colors, if you select the color that agrees with the RGB notation you win 1 point.

- If you make a mistake when choosing the color, you lose all your points.

- If you doubt which color to choose, you can use the "hint" button and it will reveal the correct color for a moment, in exchange for 1 point.

- You can reset the color gamut by pressing the "reset" button and this will cause the colors to change. But you can only do it once each time you earn a point. Choosing this option does not remove points.

- You can increase the difficulty on the buttons with the levels. Changing the difficulty removes all points earned, and on the hardest difficulty, you will have a time limit of 8 seconds to answer, if you don't guess the color in that time, you will lose all your points!
